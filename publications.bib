	abstract = {Layered TiS2 is of great potential in thermoelectrics for room temperature and medium temperature applications due to its tunable transport properties, low environmental impact, low cost, and lightweight. Herein, we pre­ pared FexTiS2–δ with x varying from 0 to 0.05 through a two-step process, involving initial synthesis in sealed tubes followed by spark plasma sintering. Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy indicated that Fe atoms occupy the octahedral sites in the van der Waals gaps and exist in the form of Fe2+ with a high spin state. FexTiS2–δ with x ≤ 0.02 exhibit high in-plane power factors, reaching an average of {\textasciitilde} 1.2 mWm–1K–2. The structural disorder caused by Fe intercalation leads to a significant decrease in out-of-plane lattice thermal conductivity. The anisotropy in the figure of merit, ZT, of FexTiS2–δ is suppressed due to Fe intercalation. Fe0.01TiS2–δ possesses the highest ZT of 0.39 at 625 K along the in-plane direction.},

	abstract = {Transition metal sulfides have emerged as highly promising materials in thermoelectrics owing to their economic viability and sustainable characteristics. Herein, we developed entropy-engineered sulfides based on TiS2. The process of equal doping at Ti sites resulted in a notable reduction in lattice thermal conductivity due to point defects and phase segregation induced by entropy engineering; however, it also had a substantial detrimental effect on the Seebeck coefficient. Finally, by incorporating minor doping at Ti sites with Zr, Nb and Ta, each at a concentration of 1 at\%, an impressive figure of merit of 0.38 was achieved at 625 K because minor doping was able to maintain the large Seebeck coefficient while simultaneously reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. This study not only illuminates the significant role of entropy engineering in reducing lattice thermal conduc­ tivity but also sparks interest in the potential of equivalent doping at sulfur sites for future investigations.},

In the present work, solid solution compounds with the nominal composition Ca0.8Eu0.2Ti1–xNbxO3–δ (x = 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, 0.12) were synthesized and sintered in different atmospheres, including argon (Ar) and forming gas (5 vol\% H2 in Ar). Notably, the different reduction effects of these atmospheres resulted in significant differences in phase formation, grain size, oxygen deficiency, and TE properties of the synthesized samples. Introducing additional electrons to the system by donor substitution of Ti with Nb leads to significant changes in the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. The most favorable TE performance of the prepared samples was found in the sample with x = 0.05, primarily attributed to its proper charge carrier concentration. This work highlights the crucial role of the sintering atmosphere in manipulating the TE performance of n-type CaTiO3-based ceramics, an effect similar to donor doping.},

However, ensuring the high hardness while simultaneously enhancing their electrical conductivity poses a great challenge. In this work, Si3N4-carbon composites with different carbon content were synthesized with diamond phase transformation method under high pressure and high temperature (HPHT). The α→β phase transition in silicon nitride enables the coexistence of α/β phases, offering a hardness of up to 23.15 ± 0.08 GPa, comparable to dense silicon nitride ceramics and significantly higher than synthesized silicon nitride-graphite composites. Diamond uniformly distributed in the silicon nitride matrix is graphitized at high temperatures to form conductive channels, reducing resistivity to 2 × 10-⁴ Ω•m, over a dozen orders of magnitude lower than pristine silicon nitride. This phase transition sinter mechanism provides a method for designing conductive Si₃N₄-based ceramics with high hardness.},

However, its light element compositional nature results in a large thermal conductivity, which is the main limitation of the thermoelectric performance of TiS2. Here, we report a multi-element doping strategy by incorporating equivalent (Se, Zr) elements and introducing higher-valence (Nb, Ta) and lower-valence (Y, La) elements in pairs to minimize its lattice thermal conductivity, κlat. The findings indicate a nearly 50 \% decrease in κlat across the entire temperature range, attributed to the presence of strong point-defect scattering after multielement doping. Additionally, we observed a reduced dependency of κlat on temperature in multi-element doped TiS2, as point defects can effectively scatter phonons at room temperature. As a result, the multi-element doped TiS2 attained its highest ZT value of approximately 0.4 at 625 K. Incorporating higher-valence and lower-valence elements in pairs proves to be an effective method for decreasing lattice thermal conductivity without compromising too much of its large Seebeck coefficient.},

	abstract = {Within the present work, a series of spinel-structured (MnFeCoNiX)3O4 (X = Zn, Cu, Cr) high entropy oxides (HEOs) were fabricated by co-precipitation method and the subsequent heat treatment. The phase composition, microstructure, thermal stability, magnetic property and electromagnetic (EM) wave loss ability were compre­ hensively studied. It is found that spinel-structural (MnFeCoNiX)3O4 HEOs are well-crystallized at above 800 ◦C with a space group Fd-3m. Morphological analysis reveals that grains of different HEOs contain nano-domains with particle sizes between 100 nm and 500 nm. In addition, Mn, Ni, Co, Fe, Zn, Cr and Cu elements are ho­ mogeneously distributed and the chemical states of Mn, Ni, Co and Fe are all +2 and + 3, while Cu only exists in +2 state. Thermal stability analysis shows that (MnFeCoNiCu)3O4 HEO is able to keep stable at 1000 ◦C. Moreover, the (MnFeCoNiCu)3O4 sample exhibits the best magnetic properties and EM microwave loss ability in comparison with (MnFeCoNiZn)3O4 and (MnFeCoNiCr)3O4. For (MnFeCoNiCu)3O4, the values of saturation magnetization (Ms) and coercivity (Hc) are 38.6 emu/g and 52.6 Oe, respectively. Meanwhile, (MnFeCoNiCu)3O4 displays a minimum reflection loss (RL) of − 15.5 dB at 8.48 GHz with a thickness of 4.5 mm and a wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 8.84 GHz with the sample thickness of 5 mm. It is expected that the excellent high-temperature stability and good EM wave absorbing performance of high entropy (MnFeCoNiCu)3O4 could make it potentially useful in EM wave absorption under elevated temperatures.},

In this work, poly­ crystalline boron doped diamond (p-BDD) with different boron concentration were synthesized from the mixture of graphite and boron carbide under ultra-high pressure (15 GPa) and temperature (2500–2700 K). The results indicate that no more boron atoms can be inserted into diamond when the boron concentration is above 4 at\%. The EELS spectra indicated that the boron atoms have been doped into the diamond grains, and surplus boron carbide locate at the grain boundary. The hardness measurements reveal that the p-BDD doped with 1 at\% and 23 at\% boron atoms exhibit high hardness of 78.5 GPa and 45 GPa, respectively, which is equivalent to the hardness of single crystal diamond and cubic boron nitride. The p-BDD is a semiconductor and transforms into superconductive state below 2.5 K. According to microstructure measurements, highly dense p-BDD and B4C bonded diamond exhibit superhard behavior because of the strong bonding of diamond grains by B4C additives. The oxidation temperature of these p-BDD specimens is around 1538 K in the air, which is far higher than diamond. B4C is demonstrated as a superior additive to sinter superhard and electric conductive p-BDD, which are extremely useful in areas where high hardness and electric conductive are highly desired.},

As densification mechanism viscous flow has been identified based on cross-linking reaction. The critical problems concerning gas evolution and crystallization inducing bloating and cracking are addressed through controlled thermolysis and pressure. The microstructural evolution of the SiHfN ceramics indicates that the incorporation of Hf in perhy­ dropolysilazane not only increases the ceramic yield (97.4 wt\%) and crystallization resistance (1300 ◦C), but also suppresses the transformation from α-Si3N4 to β-Si3N4 at high temperatures (1700 ◦C). Especially, HfN/α-Si3N4 nanocomposites converted by the SiHfN ceramics at 1500 ◦C show a slight weight loss of 3.13 wt\%, indicating the high temperature resistance of the ceramic nanocomposites. The method proposed in this work opens a new strategy to fabricate additive-free polycrystalline Si3N4- and amorphous Si3N4-based (nano)composites.},

This work focuses on the synthesis and ceramization of single-source precursors for the preparation of SiBN ceramics as well as the investigation of the corresponding microstructural evolution at high temperatures including molecular dynamic simulations. Carbon- and chlorine-free perhydropolysilazanes were reacted with borane dimethyl sulfide complex at different molar ratios to synthesize single-source precursors, which were subsequently pyrolyzed and annealed under N2 atmosphere (without ammonolysis) to prepare SiBN ceramics at 1100, 1200, and 1300 ℃ with high ceramic yield in contrast to previously widely-used ammonolysis synthesis process. The obtained amorphous SiBN ceramics were shown to have remarkably improved thermal stability and oxidation resistance compared to amorphous silicon nitride. Particularly, the experimental results have been combined with molecular dynamics simulation to further study the amorphous structure of SiBN and the atomic-scale diffusion behavior of Si, B, and N at 1300 ℃. Incorporation of boron into the Si–N network is found to suppress the crystallization of the formed amorphous silicon nitride and hence improves its thermal stability in N2 atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Moisture curing of polysilazane coatings at room temperature is of advantage to industrial applications, though it often takes a longer time than the other curing methods. To tackle this problem, tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) is applied in this work as an efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis and condensation reactions of polymethyl (hydro)/polydimethylsilazane coatings under ambient conditions. In the suggested catalytic mechanism, the Si–H group is nucleophilically attacked by chloride ions to form a transient Si–Cl group, which is then nucleo­ philically substituted by a hydroxyl group from the moisture environment. It is found that by adding TBAC in the polysilazane coating, 1.6 times more of the reactive groups (Si–H, Si–NH) are consumed during the curing process in a shorter time (the dry-to-touch time for the uncatalyzed and the TBAC-catalyzed polysilazane coatings are ca. 19 h and 1 h, respectively), while 2 times more of the Si–O–Si groups are formed. Owing to the significantly enhanced crosslinking rate and degree, the coating quality and the mechanical properties are greatly improved. The hardness and the elastic modulus of the coating are increased by a factor of two and four, respectively.},

The phase composition and microstructure of ceramics were characterized by using FTIR, XRD, SEM, Raman spectrum, and optical microscope. It was shown that upon increasing the sintering temperature from 1400 ◦C to 1600 ◦C, the densi­ fication of ceramics was further improved, and the disorder of free carbon in SiOC was linearly decreased with sintering temperature. In addition, it was found that the incorporation of WC particles was effective to reinforce the mechanical properties of ceramics, and relevant strengthening mechanisms were discussed here.

In this work, five commercially available polysilazanes have been spin-coated on polycarbonate substrates and cured in ambient environment and temperature to obtain transparent, crack-free, and dense films. The degree of crosslinking is found to have a significant impact on the hardness and Young's modulus of the polysilazane films but has a minor influence on the film thickness and hydrophobicity. Among all five polysilazane coatings, the inorganic perhydropolysilazane-based coating exhibits the largest hardness (2.05 ± 0.01 GPa) and Young's modulus (10.76 ± 0.03 GPa) after 7 days of curing, while the polyorganosilazane-derived films exhibit higher hydrophobicity. The molecular structure of polysilazanes plays a key role in mechanical properties and hydrophobicity of the associated films, as well as the adhesion of coatings to substrates, providing an intuitive and reliable way for selecting a suitable polysilazane coating material for a specific application.},

Therefore, this review highlights the recent progress of advanced ceramic-based EMW absorbing materials by evaluating their vital EMW absorption parameters. First, the fundamentals of EMW absorption are brieﬂy summarized, followed by the eﬀects of phase/chemical composition, micro/nano structure, and morphology on the EMW absorbing performance and associated mechanisms. Furthermore, modern strategies for the preparation of lightweight, ﬂexible and thermal resistant EMW absorbing materials are comprehensively reviewed.

Original SiC particles were coated with SiO2 using sol-gel processing and mixed with Al2O3 particles. Mullite was formed in the reaction between SiO2 and Al2O3. The isostatically pressed cylindrical pellets were sintered from 1350 °C to 1600 °C for 30 min. Physical and chemical responses were investigated by detecting changes in reﬂected power during the microwave sintering process. XRD was carried out to characterize the samples and showed that mullite could be formed at 1200 °C. Bridging of mullite whiskers between Al2O3 and SiC particles was observed by SEM and is due to a so-called local hot spot eﬀect, which was the unique feature for microwave sintering. The optimized microwave sintering temperature was 1500 °C corresponding to the maximum amount of mullite whiskers within SiC/Al2O3 composites. The high electro-magnetic ﬁeld enhanced the decomposition of mullite at higher temperatures above 1550 °C. The mechanical properties of mullite whiskers reinforced SiC/Al2O3 composites are much better than the SiC/Al2O3 composites without mullite whiskers.},
