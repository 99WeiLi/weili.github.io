abstract: Mullite whiskers reinforced SiC/Al2O3 composites were prepared by microwave
  sintering in a microwave chamber with TE666 resonant mode. Original SiC particles
  were coated with SiO2 using sol-gel processing and mixed with Al2O3 particles. Mullite
  was formed in the reaction between SiO2 and Al2O3. The isostatically pressed cylindrical
  pellets were sintered from 1350 °C to 1600 °C for 30 min. Physical and chemical
  responses were investigated by detecting changes in reﬂected power during the microwave
  sintering process. XRD was carried out to characterize the samples and showed that
  mullite could be formed at 1200 °C. Bridging of mullite whiskers between Al2O3 and
  SiC particles was observed by SEM and is due to a so-called local hot spot eﬀect,
  which was the unique feature for microwave sintering. The optimized microwave sintering
  temperature was 1500 °C corresponding to the maximum amount of mullite whiskers
  within SiC/Al2O3 composites. The high electro-magnetic ﬁeld enhanced the decomposition
  of mullite at higher temperatures above 1550 °C. The mechanical properties of mullite
  whiskers reinforced SiC/Al2O3 composites are much better than the SiC/Al2O3 composites
  without mullite whiskers.
