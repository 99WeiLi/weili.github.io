abstract: Abstract  In the present work, bulk Si 3 N 4 /HfB x N 1‐x ceramic nanocomposites
  were successfully fabricated via a polymer‐derived ceramic approach. The chemical
  reaction to form the single‐source precursor was confirmed by FT‐IR and XPS, in
  which both Si−H and N−H groups of perhydropolysilazane react with borane dimethyl
  sulfide complex and tetrakis(dimethylamido) hafnium(IV). The investigation of the
  polymer‐to‐ceramic transformation of the synthesized precursors indicates that Hf‐
  and B‐modified PHPS exhibits high ceramic yields of up to 100 wt % after pyrolysis
  at 1000 °C under ammonia. Moreover, XRD and TEM results show that the SiHfBN ceramics
  with a molar ratio of B : Hf=5 and 10 resist crystallization at temperatures up
  to 1500 °C and separate after annealing at 1700 °C into nanocomposites comprising
  of an α‐Si 3 N 4 matrix with embedded ternary HfB x N 1‐x phases, solid solutions
  of rock salt‐type HfN and HfB. Based on the investigation, warm‐pressing was applied
  to fabricate bulk SiHfBN specimens, and the oxidation behavior of samples annealed
  at 1700 °C was recorded at 1500 °C over a range of oxidation times between 1 and
  50 h. The weight changes of Si 3 N 4 /HfB x N 1‐x ceramics with B : Hf molar ratios
  of 2 : 1, 5 : 1 and 10 : 1 are 4.31 %, 4.37 % and 2.57 %, respectively. The formation
  of HfSiO 4, B 2 O 3 and SiO 2 during oxidation plays a crucial role for the improvement
  of the oxidation resistance of the Si 3 N 4 /HfB x N 1‐x ceramics.
