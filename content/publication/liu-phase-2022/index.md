abstract: In this work, a tungsten carbide (WC)-containing silicon oxycarbide (SiOC)
  glass-ceramic was prepared from WCfilled polysiloxane via pyrolysis and subsequent
  spark plasma sintering (SPS). The sintering behavior of SiOC was investigated by
  monitoring the densification temperature and shrinkage displacement. The phase composition
  and microstructure of ceramics were characterized by using FTIR, XRD, SEM, Raman
  spectrum, and optical microscope. It was shown that upon increasing the sintering
  temperature from 1400 ◦C to 1600 ◦C, the densi­ fication of ceramics was further
  improved, and the disorder of free carbon in SiOC was linearly decreased with sintering
  temperature. In addition, it was found that the incorporation of WC particles was
  effective to reinforce the mechanical properties of ceramics, and relevant strengthening
  mechanisms were discussed here. Finally, a correlation between phase composition,
  microstructure, and macroscopic performances of SiOC glass-ceramics was successfully
  derived.
