abstract: Transition-metal dichalcogenide TiS2 stands out as a sustainable candidate
  for room- and medium-temperature thermoelectric materials due to its affordability,
  non-toxicity, eco-friendly nature and use of non-critical elements. However, its
  light element compositional nature results in a large thermal conductivity, which
  is the main limitation of the thermoelectric performance of TiS2. Here, we report
  a multi-element doping strategy by incorporating equivalent (Se, Zr) elements and
  introducing higher-valence (Nb, Ta) and lower-valence (Y, La) elements in pairs
  to minimize its lattice thermal conductivity, κlat. The findings indicate a nearly
  50 % decrease in κlat across the entire temperature range, attributed to the presence
  of strong point-defect scattering after multielement doping. Additionally, we observed
  a reduced dependency of κlat on temperature in multi-element doped TiS2, as point
  defects can effectively scatter phonons at room temperature. As a result, the multi-element
  doped TiS2 attained its highest ZT value of approximately 0.4 at 625 K. Incorporating
  higher-valence and lower-valence elements in pairs proves to be an effective method
  for decreasing lattice thermal conductivity without compromising too much of its
  large Seebeck coefficient.
