abstract: Electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbing materials have attracted much attention
  in recent years due to the dramatical increase of high-frequency electronic components
  and devices, which generate electromagnetic (EM) pollution and cause serious electromagnetic
  interference (EMI). Ceramics and associated (nano)composites are widely investigated
  as EMW absorbing materials because of their excellent mechanical properties, chemical/
  thermal stabilities, and oxidation/corrosion resistance. In addition to outstanding
  EMW absorbing performance, lightweight, ﬂexibility and thermal resistance at high
  temperatures strongly aﬀect their practical applications. Therefore, this review
  highlights the recent progress of advanced ceramic-based EMW absorbing materials
  by evaluating their vital EMW absorption parameters. First, the fundamentals of
  EMW absorption are brieﬂy summarized, followed by the eﬀects of phase/chemical composition,
  micro/nano structure, and morphology on the EMW absorbing performance and associated
  mechanisms. Furthermore, modern strategies for the preparation of lightweight, ﬂexible
  and thermal resistant EMW absorbing materials are comprehensively reviewed. Finally,
  the perspectives of advancedceramics as EMW absorbing materials are discussed as
  well.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Ceramic-based materials are the most researched materials for EMW absorption applications under relatively high temperature due to their outstanding chemical and thermal stability. EMW absorbing materials with flexibility and lightweight become future challenges for the next-generation of flexible electronic devices.
