nanosheets have attracted significant attention for their potential in electromagnetic wave absorption (EWA). However, their inherent self-stacking and exorbitant electrical conductivity inevitably lead to serious impedance mismatch, restricting their EWA application. Therefore, the optimization of impedance matching becomes crucial. In this work, we developed polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)@Ti
