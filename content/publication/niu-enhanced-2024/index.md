abstract: Abstract  Ti 3 C 2 T  x  nanosheets have attracted significant attention
  for their potential in electromagnetic wave absorption (EWA). However, their inherent
  self-stacking and exorbitant electrical conductivity inevitably lead to serious
  impedance mismatch, restricting their EWA application. Therefore, the optimization
  of impedance matching becomes crucial. In this work, we developed polymethyl methacrylate
  (PMMA)@Ti 3 C 2 T  x  @SiO 2 composites with a sandwich-like core-shell structure
  by coating SiO 2 on PMMA@Ti 3 C 2 T  x  . The results demonstrate that the superiority
  of the SiO 2 layer in combination with PMMA@Ti 3 C 2 T  x  , outperforming other
  relative graded distribution structures and meeting the requirements of EWA equipment.
  The resulting PMMA@Ti 3 C 2 T  x  @SiO 2 composites achieved a minimum reflection
  loss of âˆ’58.08 dB with a thickness of 1.9 mm, and an effective absorption bandwidth
  of 2.88 GHz. Mechanism analysis revealed that the structural design of SiO 2 layer
  not only optimized impedance matching, but also synergistically enhanced multiple
  loss mechanisms such as interfacial polarization and dipolar polarization. Therefore,
  this work provides valuable insights for the future preparation of high-performance
  electromagnetic wave absorbing Ti 3 C 2 T  x  -based composites.
