abstract: Moisture curing of polysilazane coatings at room temperature is of advantage
  to industrial applications, though it often takes a longer time than the other curing
  methods. To tackle this problem, tetrabutylammonium chloride (TBAC) is applied in
  this work as an efficient catalyst for the hydrolysis and condensation reactions
  of polymethyl (hydro)/polydimethylsilazane coatings under ambient conditions. In
  the suggested catalytic mechanism, the Si–H group is nucleophilically attacked by
  chloride ions to form a transient Si–Cl group, which is then nucleo­ philically
  substituted by a hydroxyl group from the moisture environment. It is found that
  by adding TBAC in the polysilazane coating, 1.6 times more of the reactive groups
  (Si–H, Si–NH) are consumed during the curing process in a shorter time (the dry-to-touch
  time for the uncatalyzed and the TBAC-catalyzed polysilazane coatings are ca. 19
  h and 1 h, respectively), while 2 times more of the Si–O–Si groups are formed. Owing
  to the significantly enhanced crosslinking rate and degree, the coating quality
  and the mechanical properties are greatly improved. The hardness and the elastic
  modulus of the coating are increased by a factor of two and four, respectively.
