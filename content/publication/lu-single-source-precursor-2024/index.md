abstract: A dense monolithic SiC/(Ti0.25Zr0.25Hf0.25Ta0.25)C ceramic nanocomposite
  containing high-entropy carbide phase was prepared using a single-source-precursor
  method combined with spark plasma sintering. The nano­ composites were characterized
  by a unique microstructure with a homogeneous dispersion of (Ti0.25Zr0.25Hf0.25Ta0.25)C@C
  core-shell nanoparticles within a β-SiC matrix. The atomic ratios of transition
  metal elements within the in situ generated (Ti0.25Zr0.25Hf0.25Ta0.25)C nanoparticles
  can be controlled precisely by molecular design of the preceramic precursors. Oxidation
  behavior of the SiC/(Ti0.25Zr0.25Hf0.25Ta0.25)C nano­ composite was investigated
  as well. The SiC/(Ti0.25Zr0.25Hf0.25Ta0.25)C exhibit excellent oxidation resistance
  between 1200 ◦C and 1500 ◦C due to the in situ generated continuous multiphase scales
  consisting of β-SiO2, HfTiO4, ZrSiO4, HfSiO4, and Ta2O5 that can be rapidly sintered
  during oxidation. Particularly, at 1200 ◦C, the parabolic oxidation rate constant
  (Kp) value is 1–2 orders of magnitude lower than that of similar SiC/HfC, SiC/ (Hf,
  Ta)C, SiC/(Hf, Ti)C and SiC/(Hf, Zr, Ti)C nanocomposites.
