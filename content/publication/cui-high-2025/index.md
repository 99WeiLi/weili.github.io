abstract: Electrically conductive silicon nitride ceramics with both high hardness
  and electrically conductive properties are promising advancing ceramics. However,
  ensuring the high hardness while simultaneously enhancing their electrical conductivity
  poses a great challenge. In this work, Si3N4-carbon composites with different carbon
  content were synthesized with diamond phase transformation method under high pressure
  and high temperature (HPHT). The α→β phase transition in silicon nitride enables
  the coexistence of α/β phases, offering a hardness of up to 23.15 ± 0.08 GPa, comparable
  to dense silicon nitride ceramics and significantly higher than synthesized silicon
  nitride-graphite composites. Diamond uniformly distributed in the silicon nitride
  matrix is graphitized at high temperatures to form conductive channels, reducing
  resistivity to 2 × 10-⁴ Ω•m, over a dozen orders of magnitude lower than pristine
  silicon nitride. This phase transition sinter mechanism provides a method for designing
  conductive Si₃N₄-based ceramics with high hardness.
