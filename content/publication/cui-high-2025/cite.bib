 abstract = {Electrically conductive silicon nitride ceramics with both high hardness and electrically conductive properties are promising advancing ceramics. However, ensuring the high hardness while simultaneously enhancing their electrical conductivity poses a great challenge. In this work, Si3N4-carbon composites with different carbon content were synthesized with diamond phase transformation method under high pressure and high temperature (HPHT). The α→β phase transition in silicon nitride enables the coexistence of α/β phases, offering a hardness of up to 23.15 ± 0.08 GPa, comparable to dense silicon nitride ceramics and significantly higher than synthesized silicon nitride-graphite composites. Diamond uniformly distributed in the silicon nitride matrix is graphitized at high temperatures to form conductive channels, reducing resistivity to 2 × 10-⁴ Ω•m, over a dozen orders of magnitude lower than pristine silicon nitride. This phase transition sinter mechanism provides a method for designing conductive Si₃N₄-based ceramics with high hardness.},
