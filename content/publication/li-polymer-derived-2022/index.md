abstract: Within the present work, additive-free amorphous bulk SiHfN ceramics with
  excellent mechanical properties were prepared by a resource-efficient low-temperature
  molding method, namely warm-pressing. As densification mechanism viscous flow has
  been identified based on cross-linking reaction. The critical problems concerning
  gas evolution and crystallization inducing bloating and cracking are addressed through
  controlled thermolysis and pressure. The microstructural evolution of the SiHfN
  ceramics indicates that the incorporation of Hf in perhy­ dropolysilazane not only
  increases the ceramic yield (97.4 wt%) and crystallization resistance (1300 ◦C),
  but also suppresses the transformation from α-Si3N4 to β-Si3N4 at high temperatures
  (1700 ◦C). Especially, HfN/α-Si3N4 nanocomposites converted by the SiHfN ceramics
  at 1500 ◦C show a slight weight loss of 3.13 wt%, indicating the high temperature
  resistance of the ceramic nanocomposites. The method proposed in this work opens
  a new strategy to fabricate additive-free polycrystalline Si3N4- and amorphous Si3N4-based
  (nano)composites.
