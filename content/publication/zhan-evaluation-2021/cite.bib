 abstract = {Polysilazane coatings have a broad need in real-life applications, which require low processing or working temperature. In this work, five commercially available polysilazanes have been spin-coated on polycarbonate substrates and cured in ambient environment and temperature to obtain transparent, crack-free, and dense films. The degree of crosslinking is found to have a significant impact on the hardness and Young's modulus of the polysilazane films but has a minor influence on the film thickness and hydrophobicity. Among all five polysilazane coatings, the inorganic perhydropolysilazane-based coating exhibits the largest hardness (2.05 ± 0.01 GPa) and Young's modulus (10.76 ± 0.03 GPa) after 7 days of curing, while the polyorganosilazane-derived films exhibit higher hydrophobicity. The molecular structure of polysilazanes plays a key role in mechanical properties and hydrophobicity of the associated films, as well as the adhesion of coatings to substrates, providing an intuitive and reliable way for selecting a suitable polysilazane coating material for a specific application.},
