abstract: Polysilazane coatings have a broad need in real-life applications, which
  require low processing or working temperature. In this work, five commercially available
  polysilazanes have been spin-coated on polycarbonate substrates and cured in ambient
  environment and temperature to obtain transparent, crack-free, and dense films.
  The degree of crosslinking is found to have a significant impact on the hardness
  and Young's modulus of the polysilazane films but has a minor influence on the film
  thickness and hydrophobicity. Among all five polysilazane coatings, the inorganic
  perhydropolysilazane-based coating exhibits the largest hardness (2.05 ± 0.01 GPa)
  and Young's modulus (10.76 ± 0.03 GPa) after 7 days of curing, while the polyorganosilazane-derived
  films exhibit higher hydrophobicity. The molecular structure of polysilazanes plays
  a key role in mechanical properties and hydrophobicity of the associated films,
  as well as the adhesion of coatings to substrates, providing an intuitive and reliable
  way for selecting a suitable polysilazane coating material for a specific application.
