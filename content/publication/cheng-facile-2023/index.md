abstract: The appropriate multi-component strategies and ingenious microstructure
  design remain challenging for the development of multifunctional and high-performance
  electromagnetic wave absorbing materials. Here, mag­ netic Ni nanoparticles-anchored
  reduced graphene oxide (RGO)/Ti3C2Tx MXene hybrids were successfully assembled on
  melamine foam (MF) via electrostatic self-assembly and hydrazine vapor reduction
  processes, achieving high-performance electromagnetic wave absorption and multifunctionality.
  Interestingly, the RGO/ MXene/Ni-MF achieves high-performance microwave absorption
  with a minimum reflection loss value of − 61.3 dB and a maximum width effective
  absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 7.04 GHz. The superior electromagnetic wave absorption
  stems from a 3D dielectric/magnetic network with satisfactory impedance matching,
  dielectric/ magnetic losses, interface/dipole polarization and multiple reflection
  scattering. Furthermore, the RGO/MXene/ Ni-MF also revealed outstanding hydrophobicity,
  thermal insulation, infrared shielding and incombustibility. This work opens up
  novel prospects for developing lightweight, multifunctional microwave absorbers
  for practical applications.
