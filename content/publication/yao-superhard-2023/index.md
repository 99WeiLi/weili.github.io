abstract: Boron doped diamond are potential superhard materials with good electric
  conductivity. In this work, poly­ crystalline boron doped diamond (p-BDD) with different
  boron concentration were synthesized from the mixture of graphite and boron carbide
  under ultra-high pressure (15 GPa) and temperature (2500–2700 K). The results indicate
  that no more boron atoms can be inserted into diamond when the boron concentration
  is above 4 at%. The EELS spectra indicated that the boron atoms have been doped
  into the diamond grains, and surplus boron carbide locate at the grain boundary.
  The hardness measurements reveal that the p-BDD doped with 1 at% and 23 at% boron
  atoms exhibit high hardness of 78.5 GPa and 45 GPa, respectively, which is equivalent
  to the hardness of single crystal diamond and cubic boron nitride. The p-BDD is
  a semiconductor and transforms into superconductive state below 2.5 K. According
  to microstructure measurements, highly dense p-BDD and B4C bonded diamond exhibit
  superhard behavior because of the strong bonding of diamond grains by B4C additives.
  The oxidation temperature of these p-BDD specimens is around 1538 K in the air,
  which is far higher than diamond. B4C is demonstrated as a superior additive to
  sinter superhard and electric conductive p-BDD, which are extremely useful in areas
  where high hardness and electric conductive are highly desired.
