      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi there! I am Wei Li. I am working as a postdoctoral research fellow in Prof. Kathy Lu’s group. One of his research interests is focused on polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs), particularly on the development of advanced Si-based ceramic nanocomposites with tailor-made chemical/phase compositions and microstructures for structural and functional applications. Another research interest is devoted to developing innovative SiOC-based support materials for the upcycling of plastic wastes and biomass, aiming to achieve sustainable production of graphitic carbon.
